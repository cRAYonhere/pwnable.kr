Easy Way:

/******************************
fd@ubuntu:~$ ls -l
total 16
-r-sr-x--- 1 fd_pwn fd   7322 Jun 11  2014 fd
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root  418 Jun 11  2014 fd.c
-r--r----- 1 fd_pwn root   50 Jun 11  2014 flag
fd@ubuntu:~$ 
********************************/
We can see the flag but we do not have permisions to read it(https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/4/html/Step_by_Step_Guide/s1-navigating-ownership.html). Only owner of the file and users beloning to that group can access the flag.

The Binary fd has 's' flag set(https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/118853/what-does-the-s-attribute-in-file-permissions-mean). Which means anyone can run the binary and it will run with "sudo" privileges. That looks like a good window to start. 

/******************************
fd@ubuntu:~$ cat -n fd.c
     1	#include <stdio.h>
     2	#include <stdlib.h>
     3	#include <string.h>
     4	char buf[32];
     5	int main(int argc, char* argv[], char* envp[]){
     6		if(argc<2){
     7			printf("pass argv[1] a number\n");
     8			return 0;
     9		}
    10		int fd = atoi( argv[1] ) - 0x1234;
    11		int len = 0;
    12		len = read(fd, buf, 32);
    13		if(!strcmp("LETMEWIN\n", buf)){
    14			printf("good job :)\n");
    15			system("/bin/cat flag");
    16			exit(0);
    17		}
    18		printf("learn about Linux file IO\n");
    19		return 0;
    20	
    21	}
    22	
fd@ubuntu:~$ 

********************************/

We can see the binary needs (at least) two arguments. First argument is the name of the binary.
The second argument is subtracted by 0x1234.  

/********************************
gefâž¤  p/d 0x1234
$1 = 4660
*********************************/

And then it uses the result as a file descriptor(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor) and reads from it.
The result is then stored in buf and compared with string "LETMEWIN\n"
If success
then 
	flag
else
	learn more(https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/io-redirection.html)
fi

Since we need to set buf to "LETMEWIN" for it to successfully pass the check we need to set the fd to 0
fd 0 is stdin and this allows us to enter "LETMEWIN" and pwn the flag.
